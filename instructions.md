Thank you for reviewing over my project!

I have chosen to do my project using React, a JavaScript library, because I thought it would be easier to read my code as well as practice manipulating the virtual DOM.

How to start my project:

1.  Go inside the project's main folder by doing:  `$ cd bot-o-mat`

2. If you haven't already, install Node from https://nodejs.org/en/download/ .

3. Run `$ npm install` to install the dependencies needed for React(listed in the `package.json` file).

4. Do `$ npm start` inside you're terminal to start up the React development server.

5. When the page loads, input a Robot name and select a Robot type from the dropdown list. If name or type or both isn't selected, you will be prompted with an error message.

6. To complete a Robot's task, press the Robot's `complete` button and wait until the ETA is finished.

7. After the task is finished, you will be presented with a green checkmark to show completion followed by the task slowly disappearing.

Have fun!
